# 📘 Data Science, AI & Related Job Roles — Explained

This document explains what happens after data cleaning, what a model is, how predictions work, and maps **job roles** in Data Engineering, Data Science, ML, AI, GenAI, and Agentic AI with practical examples.

## 🔹 1. Once Data is Cleaned and Saved — What Happens Next?

Think of **cleaned data** as the “raw material” in a factory. You now have choices:

- 📊 **Analytics / Reporting** → Generate dashboards, reports, KPIs.  
  *Example: Sales dashboard in Power BI.*

- 📈 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** → Find correlations, distributions, anomalies.  
  *Example: Checking which products are often bought together.*

- 🤖 **Training Models** → Use cleaned data as input to build ML/AI models.  
  *Example: Train a fraud detection model.*

- 🏭 **Operational Systems** → Feed into apps needing fresh, consistent data.  
  *Example: E-commerce search using cleaned product catalog.*

## 🔹 2. What is a Model & How to Prepare/Deploy?

A **Model** = a system trained to recognize patterns and make predictions.

### Steps to prepare a model:
1. Data Preparation → Collect & clean data.  
2. Feature Engineering → Create useful variables.  
3. Choose Algorithm → Pick ML method.  
4. Training → Model learns patterns.  
5. Evaluation → Test accuracy.  
6. Deployment → Put model into production (API, batch, embedded).  

### Deployment Examples:
- As REST API (predicts on request).  
- As Batch Job (predicts future sales weekly).  
- In App (Netflix recommendations).

## 🔹 3. Static vs Dynamic Predictions

- **Static Prediction** → Trained once, used later.  
  *Ex: Train loan model on 2022 data, apply in 2023.*  

- **Dynamic / Real-Time** → Model retrained or updated often.  
  *Ex: Fraud detection updated daily.*  

- **Streaming Predictions** → Instant predictions on live data.  
  *Ex: Uber ETA prediction with live GPS.*
