# 📘 Data → AI Tech Field Career & Tools Map

This repository serves as a **comprehensive guide** to understand the **Data Science, Machine Learning, AI, GenAI, and Agentic AI ecosystem**.  
It explains **what happens with data, what a model is, how predictions are made, roles involved, and the tools/skills used**.  

---

## 🔹 1. What happens once data is cleaned?
After raw data is **collected, cleaned, and saved** into a file or database, it can be used for:

- 📊 **Analytics & Reporting** → Dashboards, KPIs  
- 📈 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** → Finding trends, anomalies  
- 🤖 **Model Training** → Feeding into ML/AI models  
- 🏭 **Operational Systems** → Powering business applications  

**Tools & Skills:**  
`SQL`, `Excel`, `Power BI`, `Tableau`, `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Spark`, `Airflow`, `Snowflake`, `BigQuery`

---

## 🔹 2. What is a Model?
A **Model** is a mathematical/statistical/AI system trained on data to **recognize patterns and make predictions**.

### 📌 Steps:
1. Data Preparation → SQL, Pandas, Spark  
2. Feature Engineering → Scikit-learn, Feature Stores (Feast, Tecton)  
3. Training → TensorFlow, PyTorch, XGBoost  
4. Evaluation → MLflow, Weights & Biases  
5. Deployment → Docker, Kubernetes, Flask/FastAPI, Seldon, SageMaker, Vertex AI  
6. Monitoring → Prometheus, Grafana, EvidentlyAI  

---

## 🔹 3. Prediction Types
- **Static Prediction** → Trained once, used for future data (batch retraining).  
- **Dynamic Prediction** → Model retrained or updated frequently.  
- **Streaming Prediction** → Real-time on live data streams.  

**Tools:** `Airflow`, `Prefect`, `Kafka`, `Flink`, `Spark Streaming`, `Redis`, `Feature Stores`
