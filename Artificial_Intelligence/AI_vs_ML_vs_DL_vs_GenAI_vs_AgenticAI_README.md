# Artificial Intelligence vs Machine Learning vs Deep Learning vs Generative AI vs Agentic AI

## 1. Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- **Definition**: The broadest field. AI is any system (software/hardware) that can perform tasks requiring "intelligence" when done by humans (reasoning, problem-solving, decision-making, perception).
- **Scope**: Includes rule-based systems, search algorithms, expert systems, ML models, planning systems, robotics, etc.
- **Examples**:
  - Chess-playing programs (Deep Blue)
  - Google Maps route optimization
  - Fraud detection systems

ðŸ‘‰ **Think of AI as the "umbrella field".**

## 2. Machine Learning (ML)
- **Definition**: A subset of AI where systems learn patterns from data instead of being explicitly programmed with rules.
- **Core Idea**: "Learn from experience (data) to improve performance."
- **Techniques**: Supervised learning, Unsupervised learning, Reinforcement learning.
- **Examples**:
  - Predicting house prices from past sales
  - Spam email classification
  - Netflix recommendation system

ðŸ‘‰ **ML is how AI gets smarter from data.**

---

## 3. Deep Learning (DL)
- **Definition**: A subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers (hence "deep") to learn complex patterns.
- **Core Idea**: Mimics how the human brain processes dataâ€”especially good for unstructured data (images, speech, text).
- **Examples**:
  - Image recognition (face unlock in phones)
  - Voice assistants (Siri, Alexa)
  - Self-driving car perception

ðŸ‘‰ **DL is ML powered by neural networks.**

---

## 4. Generative AI (GenAI)
- **Definition**: A subset of AI/DL focused on creating new content (text, images, audio, code, etc.) rather than just analyzing data.
- **Core Idea**: Models (like GPT, DALLÂ·E, Stable Diffusion) generate something new that looks human-created.
- **Techniques**: Transformer models, GANs, Diffusion models.
- **Examples**:
  - ChatGPT writing essays or code
  - MidJourney/DALLÂ·E creating images
  - MusicLM generating songs

ðŸ‘‰ **GenAI = AI that *creates* new things.**

---

## 5. Agentic AI (AI Agents)
- **Definition**: The next layer beyond Generative AI where AI systems not only generate but also act autonomously to achieve goals, often chaining multiple steps and tools.
- **Core Idea**: AI behaves like an agentâ€”planning, reasoning, taking actions, calling APIs, using memory, collaborating with humans/other agents.
- **Features**:
  - Goal-directed (not just answering)
  - Can use tools & APIs
  - Can autonomously plan multi-step workflows
- **Examples**:
  - An AI travel planner: books flights + hotels + rentals based on your budget.
  - AutoGPT / BabyAGI agents that break down tasks and execute them.
  - Customer support AI that troubleshoots, checks databases, and resolves issues without human help.

ðŸ‘‰ **Agentic AI = GenAI with reasoning + autonomy + actions.**

# Additional Key Terms

## NLP (Natural Language Processing)
- **Definition**: A subfield of AI focused on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language (text + speech).
- **Tasks**: Classification (spam detection, sentiment analysis), translation, speech-to-text, entity recognition.
- **Examples**: Chatbots, Alexa/Siri, Grammarly.

ðŸ‘‰ **NLP = AI specialized in human language.**

## LLM (Large Language Model)
- **Definition**: A type of Deep Learning model trained on massive amounts of text data to predict and generate language.
- **Relation**: Subset of NLP (specialized models), uses DL transformers (like GPT, BERT, LLaMA), powers GenAI.
- **Examples**: GPT, Claude, LLaMA, Gemini.

ðŸ‘‰ **LLM = Specialized NLP model that powers Generative AI for text.**

## Other Terms
- **CV (Computer Vision)**: AI for images/videos (object detection, medical imaging).
- **RL (Reinforcement Learning)**: Learning via rewards and punishments (AlphaGo, robotics, self-driving). Subset of ML.
- **Foundation Models**: Large adaptable models (GPT-4, DALLÂ·E).
- **Multimodal Models**: Handle text + image + audio + video (GPT-4o). Advanced form of LLM/GenAI.
